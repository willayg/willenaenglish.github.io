# Phonics Game Score Recording & Star Appearance Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Phonics Listening & Missing Letter Scores Not Recording

**Problem:**
- When players finished phonics_listening or missing_letter games, their scores weren't showing in progress bars
- Modals showed 0% even after completed games
- Root cause: Mode names `'phonics_listening'` and `'missing_letter'` weren't recognized in score calculation

**Why It Happened:**
- The `canonicalMode()` function maps game modes to 6 standard modes
- Expected modes: `['meaning', 'listening', 'multi_choice', 'listen_and_spell', 'spelling', 'level_up']`
- But `phonics_listening` returned as-is and `missing_letter` weren't in the list
- When calculating average score: `total / 6`, unrecognized modes were skipped
- Result: No scores contributed to the percentage

**Solution Applied:**
Updated the `canonicalMode()` function in all three modals to map:
- `'phonics_listening'` → `'listening'` (same as `'listen'`)
- `'missing_letter'` → `'spelling'`

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (m === 'listening' || (m.startsWith('listening_') && !m.includes('spell'))) return 'listening';
if (m === 'spelling' || (m.includes('spell') && !m.includes('listen'))) return 'spelling';

// AFTER
if (m === 'phonics_listening' || m === 'listen' || m === 'listening' || (m.startsWith('listening_') && !m.includes('spell'))) return 'listening';
if (m === 'spelling' || m === 'missing_letter' || (m.includes('spell') && !m.includes('listen'))) return 'spelling';
```

**Files Modified:**
1. `Games/Word Arcade/ui/sample_wordlist_modal.js` (line 169)
2. `Games/Word Arcade/ui/level2_modal.js` (line 175)
3. `Games/Word Arcade/ui/phonics_modal.js` (line 191)

**Result:**
Now when a student plays a phonics_listening game with 8/10 correct:
```
Before: [meaning: 0, listening: unknown, multi_choice: 0, ...] → 0% (ignored)
After:  [meaning: 0, listening: 80%, multi_choice: 0, ...] → ~13% (included)
```

### 2. ✅ Star Appearance - Outlined vs Filled

**Problem:**
- Empty stars appeared as hollow yellow outlines instead of solid filled stars
- User expected all stars to appear as solid colors (filled stars for played modes, light filled for unplayed)

**Why It Happened:**
The CSS styling for empty stars was:
```css
.star-empty { fill: none; stroke: #e8d8a8; stroke-width:1.5; }
```
- `fill: none` means no fill, just the outline stroke
- This created hollow/outlined stars

**Solution Applied:**
Changed `.star-empty` to have a light gray fill:
```css
.star-empty { fill: #e8e8e8; stroke: #c0c0c0; stroke-width:1; }
```

**File Modified:**
- `Games/Word Arcade/ui/buttons.js` (line 215)

**Result:**
- **Filled stars (1-5):** Remain yellow `#f5c518` with gold outline
- **Empty stars (0):** Now light gray `#e8e8e8` with subtle outline
- All stars appear fully colored, not outlined

## Data Flow After Fix

### Phonics Listening Game Example

**Before Fix (Broken):**
```
Player scores 8/10 in phonics_listening game
  ↓
Session saved: { mode: 'phonics_listening', score: 8, total: 10 }
  ↓
canonicalMode('phonics_listening') → returns 'phonics_listening' (unchanged)
  ↓
Check: is 'phonics_listening' in modeIds? → NO
  ↓
Score discarded, modeIds = [0, ?, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ↓
Average = 0 / 6 = 0% ❌
  ↓
Modal shows: 0% with no stars
```

**After Fix (Working):**
```
Player scores 8/10 in phonics_listening game
  ↓
Session saved: { mode: 'phonics_listening', score: 8, total: 10 }
  ↓
canonicalMode('phonics_listening') → returns 'listening' (mapped)
  ↓
Check: is 'listening' in modeIds? → YES
  ↓
Score counted: listening = 80%, modeIds = [0, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  ↓
Average = 80 / 6 ≈ 13% ✅
  ↓
Modal shows: 13% with stars and accurate progress bar
```

## Testing Checklist

After deploying these changes, verify:

1. **Score Recording:**
   - ✅ Play a phonics listening game with 6+ words
   - ✅ Complete with some correct answers (e.g., 8/10)
   - ✅ Close phonics modal and reopen it
   - ✅ Verify: Progress bar shows non-zero percentage
   - ✅ Repeat for missing_letter mode

2. **Star Appearance:**
   - ✅ Open any modal (sample, level 2, or phonics)
   - ✅ Look at star ratings for each mode
   - ✅ Verify: All stars appear solid filled (not outlined)
   - ✅ Yellow filled stars for played modes
   - ✅ Gray filled stars for unplayed modes

3. **Hard Refresh:**
   - ✅ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear cache
   - ✅ Test all three modals
   - ✅ Verify progress bars update correctly

## Technical Details

### Canonical Mode Mapping

The `canonicalMode()` function now recognizes:

**Listening modes:**
- `'listening'` → `listening`
- `'phonics_listening'` → `listening`
- `'listen'` → `listening`
- `'listening_*'` (variants) → `listening`

**Spelling modes:**
- `'spelling'` → `spelling`
- `'missing_letter'` → `spelling`
- `'spell*'` (variants except listen_and_spell) → `spelling`

**Other modes:** (unchanged)
- Meaning/Matching → `'meaning'`
- Multi-choice/Picture → `'multi_choice'`
- Listen and Spell → `'listen_and_spell'`
- Level Up → `'level_up'`

This ensures all variations are counted in the 6-mode average calculation.
