# Conditional Unscramble Game

## Overview
The Conditional Unscramble Game is an interactive web-based game designed to help students practice and improve their understanding of conditional sentences. Players will be presented with scrambled conditional sentences and must unscramble them to form the correct sentences.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **src/conditional_contents.js**: Contains an array of objects representing scrambled conditional sentences. Each object includes the original sentence and its scrambled version.
- **src/conditional.js**: Handles the game logic, imports sentences from `conditional_contents.js`, manages the game state, displays scrambled sentences, and checks the player's answers.
- **src/conditional.html**: Serves as the main HTML interface for the game, including elements for displaying scrambled sentences, input for player answers, and buttons to submit answers and restart the game.

## How to Play
1. Open the `conditional.html` file in a web browser.
2. You will see a scrambled conditional sentence displayed on the screen.
3. Unscramble the sentence by typing your answer in the provided input field.
4. Click the "Submit" button to check your answer.
5. If your answer is correct, you will receive positive feedback. If not, you will be prompted to try again.
6. You can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Setup Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) is recommended for the best experience.
- No additional setup is required; simply open the `conditional.html` file to start playing.
