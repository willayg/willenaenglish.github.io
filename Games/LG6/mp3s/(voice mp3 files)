The mp3s directory is intended to contain the voice mp3 files generated by the Python script. Since the contents of this directory will be populated by the audio files created from the sentences in `lg6_SENTENCES.md`, the directory itself will not contain any files initially. 

Therefore, the contents of the file `/LG6/LG6/mp3s/(voice mp3 files)` will be intentionally left blank. 

mp3s directory is ready to be populated with audio files.
