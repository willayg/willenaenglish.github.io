Korea is known for having a temperate climate. During the warmer months, the average monthly temperatures reach above 10 degrees Celsius, while in the colder months, they drop down to minus 3 degrees Celsius.

This temperature range means that tropical fruits do not usually grow in Korea.

However, this agricultural pattern has been changing in some of the nation’s southern regions.

For instance, Wando County in South Jeolla Province recently harvested apple mangoes, which are usually found in Southeast Asia.

The idea to grow the golden yellow fruits started in 2018, when some farmers in the region teamed up with the Agricultural Technology Center.*

They learned about apple mangoes and built greenhouses to cultivate them.

Besides apple mangoes, Wando County has planted banana trees and is now planning to grow coffee beans, which are traditionally produced in countries near the equator such as Ethiopia, Brazil, and Kenya.

These surprising agricultural developments can be attributed to global warming.

According to the Korea Meteorological Administration,* the nation’s average yearly temperatures and precipitation levels are rising.

In turn, this trend is causing conditions to become favorable for growing tropical fruits.

Along with apple mangoes, several major tropical fruits can now be found growing in the southern regions of Korea.

They include passion fruits, dragon fruits, papayas, and guavas.

On the other hand, global warming has also affected the apple, a staple fruit that has thrived in Korea’s temperate climate.

North Gyeongsang Province, which has the most apple orchards in the country, is now trying to adapt to changing climate conditions.

This includes growing altogether new varieties of apples for the market.
