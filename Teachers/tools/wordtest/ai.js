Passage:
${passage}
      `;
      break;
    case 'phrases':
  promptContent = `
You are an ESL teacher. From the passage below, extract all the phrases and idioms (not single words) that appear in the text. Focus on:

- Multi-word expressions, collocations, and set phrases
- Idiomatic expressions and figurative language
- Phrasal verbs, prepositional phrases, and common sayings

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include simple adjective+noun or noun+noun combinations unless they are idioms, set phrases, or have a figurative/idiomatic meaning (e.g., "big rock" or "empty jar" should NOT be included unless they are part of an idiom)
- Only include phrases and idioms (no single words)
- Each item must be a phrase of two or more words
- Do NOT include duplicate or very similar phrases
- Provide as many unique phrases/idioms as you can find in the passage (up to ${numWords})

For each phrase or idiom, provide the English phrase, then a comma, then the Korean translation.
  IMPORTANT: The Korean translation should be a culturally appropriate, natural equivalent that conveys the same meaning or feeling as the English idiom, not a literal word-for-word translation. If there is a common Korean idiom or phrase that matches the meaning, use that. If not, paraphrase so that a Korean speaker would understand the intended meaning in context.

  Examples (format: english, korean):
- let the cat out of the bag, 비밀을 털어놓다
- the elephant in the room, 모두가 알지만 말하지 않는 문제
- hold your horses, 진정해
- bite off more than you can chew, 욕심을 과하게 부리다
- once in a blue moon, 거의 드물게
