// Dropdown open/close logic for File/More menus - simplified since file_menu.html has its own script
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // More menu dropdown will be set up by main.js after loading file_menu.html
});

// Remove the import() approach as it's causing issues
// The functions will be exposed directly by inline_toolbar.js
