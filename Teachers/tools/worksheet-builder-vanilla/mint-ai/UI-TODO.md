# MINT AI Modal & Worksheet Builder — UI/UX TODOs (Picture Activities & Word List)

## New UI/UX Requests (August 2025)


1. **Save Content Modal & Shared Data Model for Word Lists**
   - Tall, always-visible modal on the right side of the screen.
   - Shows all recent content (AI/user-generated).
   - Allows users to quickly drag, drop, or select old content for reuse.
   - Semi-automatic saving of raw content.
   - Implement a shared data model for word lists.
   - Allow the same list to be used across multiple formats (tests, cards, picture cards, matching games, slides, etc.)

2. **Vocab Modes**
   - Option to generate word definitions, tenses, or other data (not just translations) when generating a word list from AI.
   - User can select the desired vocab mode before generating.

3. ~~**Insert/Cancel Button Placement**~~ ✅
   - ~~Move the Insert and Cancel buttons to below the preview area for a more natural workflow.~~

4. **Picture List Layout**
   - Add a new layout: "Picture List" (similar to double/side by side, but with images).

## UI/UX Improvements

1. ~~**Add a separate "Picture Activities" icon to the sidebar**~~ ✅
   - ~~Place directly under "Vocab Box"~~
   - ~~Use a clear photo/mountain icon~~
   - ~~Keep both visible for maximum discoverability~~

3. **Add a "Recents" panel to the word list generation screen**
   - Show the last 5–10 lists
   - Provide quick load and preview functionality

4. **Add an "Also Make" button strip after generating a list**
   - Quick-convert options: Test Sheet, Picture Cards, Matching Game, Slides, etc.
   - Instantly open the chosen layout using the same list

5. **Enable "Change Layout" in the right-click menu for any word list object in the canvas**
   - Allow instant switching between layouts without re-entering the list
