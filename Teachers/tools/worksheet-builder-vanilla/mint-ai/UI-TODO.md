# MINT AI Modal & Worksheet Builder — UI/UX TODOs (Picture Activities & Word List)

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Add a separate "Picture Activities" icon to the sidebar**
   - Place directly under "Word List"
   - Use a clear photo/mountain icon
   - Keep both visible for maximum discoverability

2. **Implement a shared data model for word lists**
   - Allow the same list to be used across multiple formats (tests, cards, picture cards, matching games, slides, etc.)

3. **Add a "Recents" panel to the word list generation screen**
   - Show the last 5–10 lists
   - Provide quick load and preview functionality

4. **Add an "Also Make" button strip after generating a list**
   - Quick-convert options: Test Sheet, Picture Cards, Matching Game, Slides, etc.
   - Instantly open the chosen layout using the same list

5. **Enable "Change Layout" in the right-click menu for any word list object in the canvas**
   - Allow instant switching between layouts without re-entering the list
