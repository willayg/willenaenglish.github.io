## ðŸš§ **Remaining Development Tasks:**

3. âœ… Add a more user-friendly color selector for border color (palette + custom color picker). **COMPLETED: Integrated iro.js with Tailwind color palette**

8. The font sizer had two sets of controls. Only have the large ones on the outside.
9. âœ…Poppins and other fonts not being recgonized

11. âœ…Underline and strikeput dont work

14. âœ… Add test box copy delete and paste functions
14.1. âœ… Add undo (Ctrl+Z) and redo (Ctrl+Y) functionality (fully working)
15. âœ… Make text box resizable from every side (FIXED: removed minWidth/minHeight constraints)
16. Theres a weird bug where if I have a long passage in a text box and add a new page, the text box will resize to fit the full size of the page
17. âœ… File burger and other dropdowns should be on a higher layer to the border modal (FIXED: z-index hierarchy properly established)
18. âœ… theres a weird bug where the border turns off after the first time i edit it
19. Burger menu needs to be white?
20. âœ… Integrate Pickr color picker for font, border, and fill colors: **COMPLETED: Used iro.js instead with Tailwind palette**
    - âœ… Replace the toolbar font color input with a iro.js-powered div and ensure it updates the selected textbox's font color.
    - âœ… Ensure the border modal loads and displays iro.js for border and fill colors, updating the selected textbox in real time.
    - âœ… Remove any event listeners or code that reference the old native color inputs.
    - âœ… Clean up any unused/conflicting color picker code.

21. Weird print behaviour if I add a second page the text box shrinks vertically
22. âœ… After a box resize, it cant be made smaller again (FIXED: removed minWidth/minHeight being set to current size)
23. âœ… pASTING SHOULD PASTE WHERE THE CURSOR IS
24. Resizing is a bit weird when the text box has rounded edges
25. âœ… BUG: If you add a new page and then paste a textbox, color pickers and color logic do not work on the pasted item (needs investigation)
26. âœ… The color dropdown needsd a higher z index than the border modal
27. âœ… Build an AI modal (textbox-ai-modal.js) to automate quizzes and other features using the GPT-3.5 Turbo API. The modal allows users to generate content and auto-insert it into a textbox for later use. (COMPLETED)
28. ðŸš§ Add more tools to the left toolbar:
    - Vocab List Tool: Allows creation of vocabulary lists with AI-powered image generation for each word.
    - Puzzle Tool: Lets users generate and insert puzzles (e.g., crosswords, word searches) into the worksheet.
    - Reading Passage Tool: For inserting and managing reading passages, possibly with AI assistance.
    - (The toolset will continue to grow as new needs are identified.)
29. ðŸš§ As index.html grows, modularize:
    - Move inline scripts to dedicated JS files (one per tool/feature/modal where possible)
    - Move inline styles and style attributes to CSS files
    - Use HTML includes or JS templates for reusable UI (modals, toolbars, etc.)
    - Keep index.html focused on structure and layout only
    - This will keep the project scalable and maintainable as more tools are added
30. âœ… Add a Title/Header/Footer Tool:
    - Users can add and edit a title, header, and footer that appear on all pages.
    - Supports templated titles and multiple layout options.
    - Easy to update and preview across the worksheet. (COMPLETED)

31. ðŸš§ Add an automated image insertion tool that uses pixabay and lexica with api or backend.  CGDream.ai and https://www.lummi.ai/ with some others for image search


32. âœ… Print needs to ignore all modals. (FIXED)
33. âœ… Inserting a text box removes the header (FIXED)
34. âœ… Fix border modal event handler conflicts (FIXED):
    - Unified handler for border modal for both textboxes and headers.
    - No more duplicate/conflicting event handlers.
    - Modal never freezes or blocks the UI, and always reflects the correct border state for the selected element.
35. ðŸš§ Fix drag handle and dragging for vocab boxes and text boxes:
    - Drag handle should always appear and work reliably for both vocab boxes and text boxes.
    - Dragging should never interfere with text editing or other features.
    - Drag handle should be visible and usable on all platforms/browsers.
    - Refactor and modularize drag logic if needed for maintainability.
    - Test with long text, resizing, and all box types.
    36. ðŸš§ Rescale the main UI (toolbars, buttons, menubars, etc.) for better usability and visual balance across devices.
