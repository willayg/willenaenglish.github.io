# Worksheet Builder

This is a React app for creating customizable teacher worksheets with drag-and-drop text and image boxes, AI integration via modals, and print/export that matches the on-screen preview. The app is styled to match the look and feel of other tools on the site.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser to the local server URL (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Features (Planned)
- Header and horizontal toolbar matching site style
- Drag-and-drop worksheet page editor
- AI integration via modals
- Print/export matches preview

## Folder Location
This app is located in `Teachers/tools/worksheet-builder/` and does not affect any other site files.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
